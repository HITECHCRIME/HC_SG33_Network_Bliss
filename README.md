# HC_SG33_Stalker

BLISS/STALKER <-
MINE

TOTAL MAKEOVER TIME

[CHORUS]
always present, reckless smoking, staring, feeling empty rooms (13)
racking scars on my soul, such a stealth move (10)
split mind, naked walls, truly wishing it was you (12)
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do (11)
watching what ya mean, watching what ya do
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do

[VERSE 1]
omnipresent subject, no criminal ties, go ahead (?) no intentions (?)

gouge my eyes, gouge my heart, let me die
let me run for the night, let me show (see) the sparks

see your object (connections) shine, access or no access ain't no try

subliminal lies, check the time in my mind
fuck the social since - it became so focal
networks rise and fall, i still scroll through it all
cast on net with coded sys, overlay is such a bliss

(subliminal lies, check the time in my mind

[CHORUS]
always present, reckless smoking, staring, feeling empty rooms --- (13)
racking scars on my soul, such a stealth move (10)
split mind, naked walls, truly wishing it was you (12)
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do (11)
watching what you mean, watching what you do 
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do

[VERSE 2]

seeing lies, breath arising, it's so fine
heightened states, 
x
x
spreading the wrong intentions with no visible remorse 
in a broken edgeless mirror you are stuck - ya
cutting through the data's path of choice
(right,) their attention drops, viewers out of luck
i'm still here, distant eye watching close

[CHORUS]
always present, reckless smoking, staring, feeling empty rooms (13)
racking scars on my soul, such a stealth move (10)
split mind, naked walls, truly wishing it was you (12)
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do (11)
watching what ya mean, watching what ya do
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do

ey ey ya
by now you are mine
you're my prize yeah


---
gotta tune and record the vocal to proper timing from the instastory (that fit perfectly)

Network bliss

(I'm never through with you)

(ignoring what i mean, watching what i do)
