# HC_SG33_Stalker

BLISS/STALKER/MINE

[CHORUS]
always there, reckless smoking, staring, feeling empty rooms (13)
racking scars on my soul, such a stealth move (10)
split mind, naked walls, truly wishing it was you (12)
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do (11)
watching what ya mean, watching what ya do (anticipating what you do)
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do

[VERSE 1]
no criminal ties (?) omnipresent subject 
gouge my eyes, gouge my heart, let me die
let me run for the night, let me show the sparks
see you shine, access or no access ain't no try

subliminal lies, check the time in my mind
fuck the social since - it became so focal
networks rise and fall, i still scroll through it all
cast on the net (with) coded sys, 
by now you're mine / seeing lies

distant eye watching close

[CHORUS]
always present, reckless smoking, staring, feeling empty rooms --- (13)
racking scars on my soul, such a stealth move (10)
split mind, naked walls, truly wishing it was you (12)
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do (11)
watching what you mean, watching what you do 
i'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do

(you're my prize yeah)



---
gotta tune and record the vocal to proper timing from the instastory (that fit perfectly)

Network bliss

(I'm never through with you)

(ignoring what i mean, watching what i do)
