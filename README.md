BLISS/STALKER


13 Always present, reckless smoking, staring, feeling empty rooms +1 ---

10 Racking scars on my soul, such a stealth move +4 -

12 Split mind, naked walls, truly wishing it was you -
11 I'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do +1

watching what you mean, watching what you do 
I'm never through with bliss, stalkin' what you do
I'm never through with you

ignoring what i mean, watching what i do

Omnipresent subject, no criminal ties (?)
Gouge my eyes, gouge my heart, let me die
Let me run for the night, let me show you sparks
Your eyes shine, access or no access ain't no try
? subliminal lies
? check the time
? in my mind

fuck the social since when it became a focal
networks rise and fall, i still scroll through it all
cast on the net, coded sys, by now you are mine (?)

gotta tune and record the vocal to proper timing from the instastory (that fit perfectly)
